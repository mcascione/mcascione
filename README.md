I'm a Full Stack Web Developer with experience in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Node, SQL and React. I've worked at Balance Homes as Head of Homeowner Experience, where I was part of a team working to end foreclosure with a more affordable, flexible way to own a home. Prior to that, I spent over three years at Opendoor, most recently as a Sr. Manager of Customer Experience. This front-of-the-house experience triggered a love for building great product that connects and aligns users with the mission of the business.

My mission is to work smarter, learn faster, and grow every day. I'm currently sharpening my technical skills in the Full Stack Web Development program at BloomTech and recently completed a Full Stack Web Development certificate program at Udemy. With my passion for learning and drive to succeed, I'm excited to tackle new challenges and contribute to dynamic teams.
